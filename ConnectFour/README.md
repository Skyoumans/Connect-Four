# Connect Four - Project One


## Skylar Youmans

### Objectives

* Create three functions to listen for winning values
    * A function that will find all horizontal wins
    * A function that will find all vertical wins
    * A function that will find all vertical wins

### About my game

    The goal here was to create a copy of the classic game, "Connect Four". I 
    
    started by breaking the game down into the basic parts and actions behind 
    
    playing. I made a 6x7 grid of buttons within a table, giving them all a 
    
    class of "board". I created the structure of the grid with a 
    
    two-dimensional array with columns containing the value of 0, where the 0 
    
    stands for an empty space. 'Red' and 'black' elements replace 0 within the 
    
    array with either a red or black disc.



    I used jQuery to check if there were four elements in a row or column that 
    
    would allow for a win. To begin with, I used a geometrical grid concept to 
    
    create the functions, scanning the x and y location of the button pressed 
    
    to check and tally any surrounding buttons with the same color defined.

### Challenges & Unfinished Problems

    * Creating a game over button that will reset the board
    * Keeping score of Player One and Two wins
    * Adding in an AI option
    * Declaring a Draw Game
